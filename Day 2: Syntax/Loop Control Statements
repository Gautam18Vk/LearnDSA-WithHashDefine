🛑 Break Statement
break immediately stops the loop and jumps out of it.
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3)
        break;
    cout << i << " ";
}
🖥️ Output
1 2
When i is 3, the loop says “I’m done” and exits completely.


🔁 Continue Statement
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3)
        continue;
    cout << i << " ";
}
🖥️ Output
1 2 4 5
When i equals 3, it just skips printing that value and keeps going.
